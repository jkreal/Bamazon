# Bamazon - Node.js + MySQL
Assignment #11 - MySQL. For this program we used MySQL to keep a database of products for Bamazon. We used node.js as the framework. 

## Getting Started
Prereq: [Have node installed](https://nodejs.org/en/);
```
1.Clone the repo
2.'npm init -y' within the root of the folder. 
3.'npm install --save' should install all the modules you need
```

You should now be ready to use Bamazon

##Usage
'node bamazonCustomer.js' to run customer view of Bamazon. It will show you a list of products and will ask you to pick a product id, then a quantity. If the item is out of stock, it will not be purchased.
